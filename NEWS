MGP v 1.3.0 7/19/2024
-------------------
  *Added review functionality to MGP. Users with Supervisor or Director level access
  will only be able to review what is populated in the Match Grade Software and what 
  is calculated by MGP, where any discrepancies between the two tables are noted. Users
  with technologist level access will only be able to perform calculations with MGP.
  *Updated alignments to v 3.57.0
  *Modified BLAASD to append the suffix to any suffix alleles in the trimmed_allele columns.
  Suffixes were not captured previously for suffix alleles > 2 fields

MGP v 1.2.0 6/10/2024
-------------------
  *Minor change to logic to calculate the total number of mismatches. Instead of
  calculating matches by Total Matches = Total - max(GvH, HvG), calculate number
  of mismatches to subtract from by taking the max of GvH and HvG at each locus 
  and adding them all together; subtract total from that sum
  *Moved check for NMDP alleles to donor assessment for loop; no need to examine
  entire MG DF for NMDP if only one donor will be processed at a time.
  *Add version # to nmdp.rda file. Use file path with 'nmdp' pattern to load
  file. This is to accomodate future auto-upload of NMDP files

MGP v 1.1.1 5/3/2024
-------------------
  *Data type conversion for donor selection to character - otherwise updated numeric
  values are appended with a '.'
  *Minor fix to the 'Run MGP' button logic. Since only one donor is selected a time,
  logic for enabling button was not occurring for subsequent runs after the first run,
  since there was technically no donor selection. Added a 'Nothing selected' as the 
  default option, which now ensures the 'Run MGP' button is disabled until
  a donor is selected.

MGP v 1.1.0 4/24/2024
-------------------
  *Changes to sample number derivation -- if a recipient does not have IgG testing, 
  'Recipient DSA Date' is to be left blank. DSA will be set to 'U'. 
  *For a given sample number, filter to only LSAB1 and LSAB2 results
  *Changes to the 'Donor Selection' drop down. Only one donor may be selected at a time,
  and choices are now the donor's last name + first name + donor ITL, instead of only the donor ITL. 
  *Changes to instructions
  
MGP v 1.0.0 3/24/2024
-------------------
  *Initial release
