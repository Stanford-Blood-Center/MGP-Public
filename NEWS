  *Changes to sample number derivation -- if a recipient does not have IgG testing, 
  'Recipient DSA Date' is to be left blank. DSA will be set to 'U'. 
  *For a given sample number, filter to only LSAB1 and LSAB2 results
  *Changes to the 'Donor Selection' drop down. Only one donor may be selected at at time,
  and choices are now the donor's last name + first name + donor ITL, instead of only the donor ITL.
