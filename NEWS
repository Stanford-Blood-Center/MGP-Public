MGP v 1.1.1 5/3/2024
-------------------
  *Data type conversion for donor selection to character - otherwise updated numeric
  values are appended with a '.'
  *Minor fix to the 'Run MGP' button logic. Since only one donor is selected a time,
  logic for enabling button was not occurring for subsequent runs after the first run,
  since there was technically no donor selection. Added a 'Nothing selected' as the 
  default option, which now ensures the 'Run MGP' button is disabled until
  a donor is selected.

MGP v 1.1.0 4/24/2024
-------------------
  *Changes to sample number derivation -- if a recipient does not have IgG testing, 
  'Recipient DSA Date' is to be left blank. DSA will be set to 'U'. 
  *For a given sample number, filter to only LSAB1 and LSAB2 results
  *Changes to the 'Donor Selection' drop down. Only one donor may be selected at a time,
  and choices are now the donor's last name + first name + donor ITL, instead of only the donor ITL. 
  *Changes to instructions
