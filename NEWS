MGP v 1.2.0 6/10/2024
-------------------
  *Minor change to logic to calculate the total number of mismatches. Instead of
  calculating matches by Total Matches = Total - max(GvH, HvG), calculate number
  of mismatches to subtract from by taking the max of GvH and HvG at each locus 
  and adding them all together; subtract total from that sum
  *Moved check for NMDP alleles to donor assessment for loop; no need to examine
  entire MG DF for NMDP if only one donor will be processed at a time.
  *Add version # to nmdp.rda file. Use file path with 'nmdp' pattern to load
  file. This is to accomodate future auto-upload of NMDP files

MGP v 1.1.1 5/3/2024
-------------------
  *Data type conversion for donor selection to character - otherwise updated numeric
  values are appended with a '.'
  *Minor fix to the 'Run MGP' button logic. Since only one donor is selected a time,
  logic for enabling button was not occurring for subsequent runs after the first run,
  since there was technically no donor selection. Added a 'Nothing selected' as the 
  default option, which now ensures the 'Run MGP' button is disabled until
  a donor is selected.

MGP v 1.1.0 4/24/2024
-------------------
  *Changes to sample number derivation -- if a recipient does not have IgG testing, 
  'Recipient DSA Date' is to be left blank. DSA will be set to 'U'. 
  *For a given sample number, filter to only LSAB1 and LSAB2 results
  *Changes to the 'Donor Selection' drop down. Only one donor may be selected at a time,
  and choices are now the donor's last name + first name + donor ITL, instead of only the donor ITL. 
  *Changes to instructions
